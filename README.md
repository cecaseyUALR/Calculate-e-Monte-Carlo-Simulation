# Calculate-e-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Random number generation is used to simulate area under a curve (integral of 1/x) between left-end point 2 and right-end point 4. If area between 1 and midpoint is greater than 1, the midpoint becomes the new left-end point, otherwise the right-end point. Stop when difference between endpoints is minuscule.
